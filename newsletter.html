        <br>CM Kejriwal's lawyer Rishikesh Kumar said, “The Supreme Court has granted him temporary bail while referring the issue of section 19 and the necessity of arrest to a larger bench.
         CM Kejriwal will continue to be detained as his bail in the CBI case is still pending. This marks a significant triumph.”
        However, the Delhi CM will remain incarcerated since he is in custody in the CBI case in the excise policy matter.
        
        The top court further added that courts can't direct Kejriwal to step down because of his arrest, adding, “It's for him to take a call”.
        
        "It has been directed that Arvind Kejriwal should be released from jail. However, after the trial court had granted him bail, he was also arrested by CBI in a related but separate case. 
        Kejriwal has initiated proceedings in that case also which is pending and coming before the High Court of the 17th. His actual release from the jail will depend on the outcome of the CBI case," said Supreme Court lawyer Shadan Farast on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's bail.

            <br>US President Joe Biden mixed up the name of his vice president, Kamala Harris, and his Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday as more of the 81-year-old incumbent's Democratic colleagues call on him to end his re-election bid.

            Biden faces growing doubts from donors, supporters and fellow Democrats, who fear he no longer has the ability to beat former President Trump in the November 5 election, or to lead the country for another four-year term.
            "Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if she was not qualified to be president. So start there," Biden said as he responded to a question from Reuters about his confidence in Harris.

That came a few hours after Biden mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as "President Putin."
"Ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said at the NATO summit in Washington, drawing gasps from those in the room before correcting himself.

NATO members are wrapping up a summit in Washington where they extended support to Ukraine to combat the invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022.

Biden's campaign has been on the ropes for two weeks, since his poor debate performance against Trump, 78.

So far, 13 of the 213 Democrats in the House and one of the Senate's 51 Democrats have appealed publicly to the president to withdraw from the race. More could make their concerns public if he fares poorly.

        <br>Trump, 78, was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.

        Trump's lawyers, in asking Merchan for the conviction to be dismissed, cited the landmark Supreme Court ruling from earlier this month that a president enjoys "absolute immunity" for official acts.
        Some of the evidence introduced by prosecutors during the hush money trial involved actions taken while Trump was in the White House and testimony from White House aides, they said.
        
        Trump, who is expected to be formally named the Republican Party nominee for president next week, had been scheduled to be sentenced in the case on Thursday, but Merchan postponed sentencing following the Supreme Court ruling.
        
        Merchan said he will rule on the Trump dismissal motion on September 6 and hold sentencing -- if still necessary -- on September 18.
        Manhattan prosecutor Alvin Bragg said in an earlier court filing that he was not opposed to the sentencing delay, but that he believed the "defendant's (dismissal) arguments to be without merit."

Trump, the first former US president convicted of a crime, faces four criminal cases and has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the November election.

He faces charges in Washington and Georgia related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.

Trump is also accused in an indictment filed in Florida of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.

        <br>According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the pre-monsoon period of May, June, and July traditionally witnesses a dip in automobile sales. In response to this seasonal trend, OEMs and dealers introduce various promotional programmes, including discounts, offers, exchange offers, money-back schemes, and vouchers.
        “These initiatives play a crucial role in stimulating market demand during these months. The collective efforts of OEMs and dealers in rolling out these promotions are greatly appreciated, as they contribute significantly to sustaining sales momentum during an otherwise low period,” Manish Raj Singhania, President, FADA, said.
        
       
        To be sure, discounts and other benefits were already being offered on compact cars and sedans, and they have recently been extended to hot-selling Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). For the last few months, car dealers have been offering cash discounts ranging from as low as Rs 10,000 and going up to Rs 3.3 lakh, depending on the price points of the models. This is in addition to the affordable variants that carmakers are introducing to lure buyers.
        
        Maruti Suzuki India
        
        Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which slashed the prices of the automatic transmission variants of its compact cars, is offering discounts across its lineup. Across its Arena showrooms, the company is offering a cash discount of Rs 10,000 on Brezza Automatic, Rs 30,000-45,000 on Alto K10 (variant wise), Rs 35,000-40,000 on S-Presso, Rs 30,000-40,000 on WagonR, Rs 10,000-20,000 on Eeco, and Rs 10,000-15,000 on Dzire, as per dealer sources.

To mark the occasion, Alia took to Instagram on Thursday to share a heartfelt clip featuring some of her most memorable moments from the film, accompanied by the caption, “#10YearsOfHumptySharmaKiDulhania.”

      
        Alia’s excitement was palpable as she also re-shared a post from director Shashank Khaitan, who shared a throwback photo of the trio—Alia, Varun Dhawan, and himself. In his post, Shashank expressed his gratitude, writing, “10 Years… Wow… Only Gratitude… Thank you Universe…” Varun also joined in the celebration by posting a classic movie poster, reminiscing about their journey together.

        ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’, directed by Shashank Khaitan, was a pivotal film that further solidified the chemistry between Alia and Varun, who had first appeared together in ‘Student of the Year’ back in 2012. The film not only won hearts with its engaging storyline but also with its memorable soundtrack, particularly the soulful duet “Samjhawan” by Arijit Singh and Shreya Ghoshal.

        So then - what does refinement look like? Sure, riffing on sample sizes of "one Test" is poor form. And while this is a strong West Indian attack - sharper, and with proven success in the same Australian conditions that England will face in 2025-26 - a sub-par 121 in their first innings had them up against it from the start, even before Shamar Joseph limped off.
        Even so, England's 90 overs was the fourth-longest they have batted in a home innings during McCullum's tenure, while their total of 371 was the third slowest (4.12 runs per over) of their 11 300-plus scores since he took over in June 2022.

            <br>Sometimes, all we want is our comfort content; to immerse ourselves in a fictional world we know and love. But instead of championing new voices, instead of returning to those original, familiar stories, Hollywood wants us to consume new takes on old sh*t—in turn, ruining our tried-and-true comfort watches.
    
            Would I rewatch Friends or The O.C. if I knew the story would continue 20+ years later? Do we need to see Remy's life at his bistro in a potential Ratatouille 2? Probably not. These standalone stories are perfect as they are. Even when franchises end on a perfectly satisfying note with all lingering storylines complete, there's a high chance some executive will decide on a whim that the story should be prolonged, no matter if it's been less than a decade since its end. Nostalgia might be at an all-time high, but familiarity breeds contempt, and some things are better left untouched.

                    <br>The brand is part of a rising crop of homegrown labels reimagining their physical stores as spaces of cultural discovery that bring together a community. Faced with an explosion of retail options, the rise of online platforms with instant delivery timelines, and the influx of international luxury brands to the Indian market, fashion stores are now stepping beyond the template of a traditional retailer to curate offbeat events ranging from music gigs to art shows to food trails.
    
                    “We want people to walk into our store and feel like they,re in a really cool basement or art gallery, where they can discover something new”, explains Capsul,s co-founder Bhavisha Dave. The brainchild of former brand marketeers Dave and Meenakshi Singh, Capsul,s carefully curated stores across Mumbai, Bangalore, and Ahmedabad regularly serve as backdrops for tattoo workshops, b-boy showcases, and even sushi takeovers. “Friendships and even love stories have started through our events,” Dave says with a laugh.
